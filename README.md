This is a simple project to understand the working of react redux.
Two components component1 and component2 are on the same level in the hierarchy.
In component1, we add items to the list which is stored in the redux store using mapDispatchToProps
In component2, we retrieve the items from the list array in the redux store using mapStateToProps
